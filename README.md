# Basic-Principal-Components-Analysis

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (WDBC). Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) 
of a breast mass. 
They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (benign (1) or malignant (2)).

Ten real-valued features are computed for each of 3 cell nuclei, yielding a total of 30 descriptive features.The 10 features (in order)
are:

radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
perimeter
area
smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
compactness (squared perimeter / area - 1.0)
concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
symmetry
fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

I tried to apply the basic Principal Components Analysis techniques in order to better understand this method.
I hope you'll find useful and distinct the steps guiding you throughout the process!

Enjoy!
